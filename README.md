## Introduction

Welcome to the Eterra Pathfinder Guide, focused on helping experienced Path of Exile players transition to Last Epoch's systems. While both games share ARPG fundamentals, Last Epoch takes different approaches to progression, itemization, and endgame.

This guide covers Season 2: Tombs of the Erased content (launching April 17, 2025), highlighting the Woven faction, Sentinel rework, expanded endgame systems, and the deterministic crafting options that differentiate Last Epoch from other ARPGs.

## Disclaimer

I've been playing Path of Exile off and on since 2014 and Last Epoch since it went into early access on Steam in April of 2019. Nevertheless, I'm a filthy casual; I'm not a "theorycrafter" level expert in either game. This guide represents my understanding based on years of gameplay, but mistakes are a certainty because there's a lot in these two games and I haven't played every PoE league.

I am not an employee of Eleventh Hour Games (the developers of Last Epoch) and have no affiliation with them. I'm just an enthusiastic fan sharing my experience to help others.

If you spot any inaccuracies or have suggestions for improvement, please leave a comment. Your feedback helps make this resource better for everyone in the Last Epoch community.

## Core Game Systems: Quick Reference

For PoE players, here's a breakdown of the key differences in Last Epoch's core systems:

### Character Progression

- **Character Level**: Functions similarly to PoE but with a lower number of active skills at any one time (5 instead of 8-9 in endgame PoE builds).

- **Passive Points**: Earned from leveling and quests. Simpler tree structure than PoE's sprawling passive web, but with dedicated class and mastery sections.

- **Skills**: Unlike PoE's gem system, Last Epoch has fixed skills with their own dedicated trees.

- **Skill Points**: Skills level through use (max level 20), with each level providing 1 skill point for that skill's tree. Both base power and mechanics can be modified by these trees.

- **Masteries**: After spending 20 passive points in your base class, you choose one of three masteries (discussed later). Season 2 finally makes these respeccable, so your only unchangeable choice is now your base class, making the game very alt and respec friendly.

### Item Systems

- **Idols**: Similar to cluster jewels in functionality but placed in a dedicated inventory grid. Season 2 adds enchanting for class-specific idols.

- **Forging Potential**: Unlike PoE's unlimited currency-based crafting, each LE item has limited crafting "durability" that depletes with each craft.

- **Affixes**: Clearer prefix/suffix distinction than PoE. Higher potential tiers on exalted items (T7 vs T5 on normal items) create meaningful upgrade paths.

- **Legendary Potential**: Enables transferring random affixes from exalted items to uniques. PoE equivalent might be double-corrupted uniques but with player agency.

- **Weaver's Will/Touch**: Items that automatically improve as you kill enemies while wearing them:
  - **Weaver's Will**: Applies to unique items. As you defeat enemies while wearing the item, it gains experience and automatically adds or upgrades affixes without requiring crafting materials. Comes with a numerical value (5-28) indicating its potential for upgrades.
  - **Weaver's Touch**: New in Season 2, works similarly but specifically for class-specific Idols. When you enchant an Idol at a Woven Enchanter, it gains both an Enchanted Affix and Weaver's Touch points. Killing enemies while the Idol is equipped consumes these points to improve existing Enchanted Affixes or add new ones.
  - Both systems can be accelerated using the new Rune of Weaving, which instantly consumes progress points to upgrade the item.

### Endgame Currencies

- **Gold**: Actually useful throughout the game, unlike wisdom/portal scrolls which become irrelevant.

- **Memory Amber**: Season 2 currency for the Woven faction, earned from defeating possessed enemies in Tombs and Cemeteries of the Erased used to gain reputation and purchase Woven Echoes.

- **Crafting Shards**: Item-type-specific crafting materials for adding or upgrading affixes on gear. Similar to targeted Harvest crafts but stockable.

- **Runes and Glyphs**: Crafting modifiers that add determinism to the process. Runes affect the item as a whole (shattering, removing affixes, etc.) while Glyphs modify specific crafting outcomes.

- **Favor**: Special currency earned by defeating enemies, used to spend on faction services and list items for trade in the Merchant's Guild.

### Endgame Systems

- **Monolith of Fate**: Primary endgame system. Think of it as an Atlas without the complexity of watchstones, but with more direct target farming options.

- **Corruption**: Infinite scaling similar to Delirium depth, tied to Echo completion rather than distance.

- **Stability**: Resource earned through Echoes that gates boss encounters. No direct PoE equivalent.

- **Blessings**: Passive bonuses from timeline bosses. Similar to Pantheon powers but with more impactful stats.

- **Echoes**: Individual zones within Monoliths - basically maps without the inventory management.

- **Woven Echoes**: Season 2 mechanic allowing custom modifiers to Monoliths. Comparable to Atlas passive tree but as consumable items.

## Common Transition Challenges for PoE Players

Key adjustments when moving from Path of Exile to Last Epoch:

### Skill System Differences
- **Skills vs. Gems**: Skills are fixed to classes rather than interchangeable gems. No 6-links; instead, power comes from the skill's internal tree.
- **5-Skill Limit**: You're limited to 5 active skills, not the 8-9 total active skills of endgame PoE builds.
- **Skill Experience**: Skills level through use, more like Diablo than PoE's gem experience.

### Movement and Combat Pacing
- **Deliberately Slower Games**: Both LE and PoE2 have moved toward more deliberate combat compared to the screen-clearing speed of original PoE.
- **Movement Speed Differences**: Many PoE2 players have reported that the game feels slower than expected. LE provides movement speed increases very early in the game through boots and passive skills, making movement feel noticeably faster than PoE2 for most players.
- **Movement Skill Cooldowns**: Both games feature longer cooldowns on movement skills than original PoE, though LE compensates with fewer on-death effects.
- **Potion Systems**: LE belts have health potion slots that deplete when used but are quickly replaced by mob drops. PoE uses flasks with charges that refill when you kill enemies.

### Difficulty and Progression
- **More Forgiving Gameplay**: LE is generally more forgiving than PoE/PoE2, with smoother difficulty scaling and fewer one-shot mechanics in the campaign.
- **Power Growth**: In LE, you feel powerful earlier and more consistently. Each skill level and passive point provides noticeable power increases, giving a satisfying sense of progression.
- **Respecs and Experimentation**: LE's generous respec system encourages experimentation with different builds without severe penalties.
- **Early Viability**: Most build concepts in LE are viable through the campaign and early endgame, whereas PoE often requires specific meta builds for smooth progression.

### Defensive Layers
- **Simplified Resistances**: 75% cap with fewer overcap options, no campaign penalties.
- **Life/Ward**: Ward (similar to ES) can be built as hybrid with Life much more viably than ES/Life in PoE.
- **Active Defenses**: More focus on triggered defensive skills than PoE's passive-heavy approach.

### Item and Gearing Differences
- **Pre-Identified Drops**: All items drop identified, changing filtering strategy.
- **Deterministic Crafting**: Clear crafting paths with limited forging potential per item.
- **No External Trade**: Self-contained in-game trade system with no API or 3rd-party sites.

### Progression Expectations
- **Shorter Campaign**: Functions more as tutorial than the multi-Act progression of PoE.
- **Smoother Difficulty Curve**: Fewer sudden difficulty spikes than PoE mapping transitions.
- **Generous Respecs**: Significantly more forgiving than PoE's high-cost respec system.

Mastery classes are unlocked after spending 20 points in the base class tree and completing the mastery quest at the start of Chapter 4. You can invest points in any mastery up to level 25, but to progress further, you must ascend into that mastery by completing the mastery quest in the End of Time. 

In Season 2, you can now respec your Mastery choice by speaking to Chronomancer Lerinne, giving you flexibility to explore different builds on the same character.

## Skill Tree Optimization Tips

Last Epoch's skill trees work differently from PoE's passive tree. Here are principles for effective skill optimization:

### Fundamental Concepts
1. **Limited points**: Each skill has 20 levels maximum, providing 20 points
2. **Node connections**: Points can only be spent on nodes connected to already-allocated nodes
3. **Specialization vs. breadth**: Decide whether to go deep in fewer skills or spread points across more skills
4. **Synergy focus**: Look for nodes that complement your build's core mechanics
5. **Threshold effects**: Some nodes only become effective with minimum investment

### Planning Principles
1. **Identify build-defining nodes**: Start by finding the most crucial nodes for your build
2. **Plot efficient paths**: Map the most point-efficient path to your key nodes
3. **Consider opportunity cost**: Compare benefit of nodes against using those points elsewhere
4. **Balance offense and utility**: Consider utility nodes that improve skill usability

### Common Optimization Patterns
1. **Damage conversion**: Focus on nodes that convert damage to preferred damage types
2. **Ailment application**: For ailment builds, prioritize nodes that increase application chance/effect
3. **Area of effect**: For clear skills, enough AoE is essential before scaling damage
4. **Cast/attack speed**: Often more valuable than raw damage for both DPS and gameplay feel
5. **Proc effects**: On-hit or on-critical effects can provide significant value

### Skill-Specific Considerations
1. **Main damage skill**: Typically deserves full 20-point investment
2. **Movement skills**: Often only need specific utility nodes rather than full investment
3. **Buff skills**: Focus on duration and effect nodes rather than damage
4. **Minion skills**: Require specific stat investment (minion health, damage, etc.)
5. **Channeling skills**: Consider mana efficiency and mobility while channeling

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. **Over-investing in conversion**: 100% conversion is enough, more is wasted
2. **Ignoring tags**: Tag modifications can fundamentally change how a skill works
3. **Stacking diminishing returns**: Understand when "increased" becomes less valuable than "more"
4. **Following outdated guides**: Skill trees change between patches, verify information is current

### Class-Specific Tips
1. **Sentinel**: Balance offense and defense, look for nodes with dual benefits
2. **Mage**: Focus on spell damage type synergies across your skill selections
3. **Acolyte**: Pay attention to minion quality vs. quantity nodes based on your approach
4. **Primalist**: Watch for companion enhancement nodes that match your playstyle
5. **Rogue**: Leverage weapon-specific bonuses that match your equipment choices

## Leveling

Side quests provide passive points and idol inventory spaces, but you don't need to track them specifically—the game stops offering these rewards once you reach maximum capacity. Your map shows your progress.

The map navigation uses different time periods (similar to Acts in PoE), accessible via the map's top menu. You can move between time periods during chapters.

Skills level up through experience (max level 20). Items can push skills beyond level 20, providing both additional skill points and inherently boosting the skill's power.

To respec skill points or level alternative skills, you'll need to sacrifice some levels temporarily. These levels return relatively quickly during gameplay.

Full respecs (skills, passives, and mastery class) are always available, though major changes will cost significant gold.

## Leveling Path Guide

This condensed leveling guide will help you progress efficiently through Last Epoch's campaign and into early endgame.

### Act 1-3: Early Game (Level 1-30)
1. **Focus on one main damage skill**: Pick one primary damage skill early and invest most of your skill points here first
2. **Grab passive points**: Complete side quests with passive point rewards (marked with a node icon on the quest)
3. **Health and resistances**: Prioritize health and elemental resistances on gear
4. **Movement skill**: Get a movement skill early to improve clear speed and safety
5. **Idol slots**: Unlock all available idol slots through side quests

### Act 4-7: Mid-Game (Level 30-60)
1. **Choose your mastery**: Select and ascend into your preferred mastery class around level 30-40
2. **Skill synergies**: Start building synergies between your main skill and support skills
3. **Crafting basics**: Use your crafting shards to improve key gear pieces, focusing on:
   - Weapon damage for attack builds
   - Spell damage/cast speed for casters
   - Minion stats for summoners
4. **Health threshold**: Aim for at least 600-800 health by level 60
5. **Resistances**: Keep resistances close to cap (75%)

### Act 8-9: Late Campaign (Level 60-75)
1. **Build core mechanics**: Ensure your build's core mechanics are working properly
2. **Skill completion**: Get your main skills to level 16+ with key nodes allocated
3. **Gearing up**: Replace any outdated low-level gear, focusing on higher-level bases
4. **Defenses**: Layer different defensive mechanisms (block, dodge, endurance, ward)
5. **Health threshold**: Aim for 1000+ health or equivalent ward by level 75

### Early Endgame (Level 75-90)
1. **Complete campaign**: Finish all main story quests to unlock Monoliths
2. **Early monoliths**: Work through the first few timelines methodically
3. **Fill out passives**: Continue collecting any remaining passive points from side quests
4. **Resistance cap**: Ensure all resistances are capped (75%)
5. **Gear optimization**: Use crafting to optimize critical gear pieces
6. **Health/ward threshold**: Aim for 1200+ health or equivalent ward protection

### Transition to Empowered Monoliths (Level 90+)
1. **Complete level 90 timelines**: Finish all three level 90 monoliths to unlock empowered monoliths
2. **Corruption preparation**: Build defensive layers to handle corruption scaling
3. **Targeted farming**: Farm specific timelines for needed unique items or affixes
4. **Legendary/set items**: Start acquiring key uniques or set items for your build
5. **Boss preparations**: Prepare for timeline bosses with adequate defenses
6. **Health/ward threshold**: Aim for 1500+ health or equivalent ward protection

## Building Characters

To start, pretty much every character focuses on either Health or Ward. So, determine which route you wish to go and build your defences around that.

Health has a specific defensive stat that ward users don't really get to utilize, endurance. Endurance is a stat that enables you to take up to 60% less damage when your health is lower than your endurance threshold. You start with 20% of your max health as endurance threshold, so building more max life increases this amount.

Ward has three different mechanics that are useful in maintaining a high ward pool:
1. **Ward Retention**: This stat makes ward you gain last longer before falling back to zero, as all ward eventually wears off to zero if you do not gain any.
2. **Ward Generation**: This includes ward gain on hit, ward per second, or any other mechanic that gives the user ward.
3. **Ward Decay Threshold**: This stat enables you to always have a minimum ward amount from natural ward decay. In other words, if you have 200 ward decay threshold, and you stop gaining ward from having 1k ward, your ward will drop to 200 ward and go no lower unless you suffer damage. This stat is important as it helps you maintain a minimum level of protection.

Unlike PoE, max resistances are not as important until you reach empowered monoliths and higher corruption. So don't sweat it in early endgame if your resistance are not maxed.

One stat that pretty much every build in LE requires is either 100% crit avoidance or 100% less bonus damage taken from crits. This is required somewhere between monoliths and empowered monoliths due to how much crit chance and damage the monsters receive in echoes.

Unlike PoE, armour is always important in LE. The damage reduction on your character sheet that your armour gives you is accurate to physical hits. Also, armour is also applied to elemental hits at 50% value. So, if your armour reduces physical damage by 80%, it will reduce elemental hits by 40%.

## Ailments

LE ailments differ significantly from PoE. Some have stack limits while others can stack infinitely. Unlike PoE, hit damage doesn't directly scale most ailment damage.

Ailment scaling strategies:
- **Application rate**: Over 100% chance to apply ailments means multiple stacks per hit
- **Damage type scaling**: Ailments scale with appropriate damage modifiers (e.g., ignite scales with fire/elemental/DoT damage)
- **Indirect scaling**: Ailments benefit from hit damage increases that don't specify "hit" or "hits"

## Loot Filter Setup Guide

Last Epoch has a built-in loot filter system that's more intuitive than Path of Exile's but still requires some setup for efficiency. Here's how to optimize it:

### Basic Filter Principles
1. **Access the filter**: Press F3 in-game to open the filter menu
2. **Filter categories**: Filters are organized by item types (weapons, armor, etc.)
3. **Rule hierarchy**: Rules apply from top to bottom, with higher rules taking precedence
4. **Rule testing**: Use "Test Rules" to see which items would be caught by your current rules

### Setting Up Your First Filter
1. **Start with bases**: Set up rules for item bases you want (e.g., specific weapon types)
2. **Add affix rules**: Create rules for important affixes for your build
3. **Priority coloring**: Use different colors/sounds for different value tiers
4. **Test and refine**: Use the testing function to check your rules
5. **Save presets**: Save specific filter setups for different characters or phases

### Early-Game Filter Recommendations
1. **Show all rare+ items**: Initially keep filter broad to acquire basic gear
2. **Health and resistances**: Highlight items with health and resistance affixes
3. **Your main damage stat**: Highlight your build's primary damage stat
4. **Movement speed**: Highlight boots with movement speed
5. **Crafting materials**: Ensure all crafting materials are visible

### Mid-Game Filter Refinements
1. **Base type restrictions**: Start filtering out base types you don't need
2. **Tier thresholds**: Only show items with affix tiers above certain thresholds
3. **Multi-affix rules**: Create rules requiring multiple good affixes
4. **Special highlighting**: Create distinct visuals for potentially valuable items
5. **Crafting focus**: Highlight items with good base and crafting potential

### Endgame Filter Optimization
1. **Strict base filtering**: Show only optimal item bases for your level
2. **Exalted item focus**: Create special highlighting for exalted items with good affixes
3. **Build-specific uniques**: Highlight specific uniques you're targeting
4. **Crafting base specialization**: Highlight bases with specific implicit values
5. **Economy-aware filtering**: For trade league, highlight items with market value

### Filter Tips and Tricks
1. **Use the OR condition**: Allow multiple affix combinations to trigger the same rule
2. **Use multi-condition rules**: Combine base type + affix type + tier level for precise filtering
3. **Regular updates**: Adjust your filter as your character progresses
4. **Color coding system**: Develop a consistent color system for different item values
5. **Sound alerts**: Use different sounds for high-value drops

## World Structure: Time Eras, Zones, and Systems

Last Epoch's world is structured around time travel, offering players a unique way to experience different historical periods and endgame activities. This section will explain how the different zones, hubs, and systems interrelate.

### Time Eras and Campaign Structure

Last Epoch's campaign is divided into chapters that take place across different time periods, each with its own aesthetic, enemies, and story elements as players explore the world of Eterra in five different eras:

1. **Divine Era**: The earliest timeline and starting point of the campaign. Features areas like Heoborea and religious themes with Rahyeh's influence. This era also contains the Arena at Champions' Gate.

2. **Ruined Era**: A devastated world where the Void has broken through, forcing survivors underground. Contains Last Refuge and areas like Welryn, where the ruins of the Temple of Eterra can be found.

3. **Imperial Era**: A period dominated by the Imperial regime, featuring imperial soldiers and political intrigue. Contains several important story questlines and settlements.

4. **Ancient Era**: An optional era that can be visited during the campaign through a side quest called "An Ancient Hunt." Features prehistoric environments with dinosaurs and ancient mysteries.

5. **End of Time**: The central hub that connects all timelines and where all possible futures converge serving as the main player hub and location of many end-game features.

### The End of Time (Hub Area)

The End of Time serves as the main player hub and location for many endgame features. Lore-wise, it represents the absolute endpoint in history where all timelines converge after the Void has consumed existence, with only a shard of humanity surviving due to the Traveler's intervention.

Key features of the End of Time:

1. **NPCs and Services**:
   - Elder Gaspar: Helps Travelers unlock their potential
   - Merchant's Guild: For trading with other players
   - Various vendors and crafting services
   - Chronomancer Lerinne: Allows mastery respecs in Season 2

2. **Portals to Endgame Content**:
   - Eastern area: Gateway to the Monolith of Fate
   - Portal to Arena (after unlocking)
   - Access to all unlocked timelines

3. **Functionality**:
   - Central waypoint for fast travel
   - Safe area for gear management
   - Training dummies for testing builds
   - Social hub for multiplayer interaction

### Special Encounters

Last Epoch features several special encounters that provide unique gameplay experiences and rewards:

1. **Loot Lizards**: Added in Patch 1.1.7, these creatures carry valuable items and crafting materials and will attempt to flee when discovered. If reduced to zero health, the Lizard will drop all loot it's carrying before quickly scurrying off. While fleeing, they drop gold behind them. Different varieties exist, each with their own potential reward types.

2. **Exiled Mages**: Imprisoned magical practitioners who can be freed and fought for special "Experimental Affixes" on items.

3. **Nemesis Encounters**: Remnants of fallen warriors that can be challenged for valuable equipment.

4. **Harbingers**: Powerful bosses found within each Timeline.

### Endgame Systems

Last Epoch features three primary endgame systems, each offering different challenges and rewards:

#### 1. Monolith of Fate

The Monolith of Fate is the primary endgame system in Last Epoch, accessible through the End of Time. It consists of Timelines (islands with their own Echo Webs, Quests, and Bosses) that players must complete to progress.

Key components:

1. **Timelines**: Ten different alternate flow of events, each with their own theme, enemy types, and unique rewards. Progression through timelines follows a branching path, with new timelines unlocking as you defeat timeline bosses.

2. **Echoes**: Individual map zones within timelines that form a web-like structure. Each Echo has:
   - A specific objective to complete
   - Enemy modifiers that affect difficulty
   - Guaranteed rewards upon completion
   - Stability gain that helps unlock quest echoes

3. **Quest Echoes**: Special nodes that advance the timeline's story. Each timeline has three quest echoes, with the third being a boss battle.

4. **Timeline Bosses**: Powerful enemies that guard each timeline. Defeating them:
   - Unlocks new timelines
   - Grants Blessings (passive bonuses)
   - Drops timeline-specific unique items

5. **Corruption System**: A mechanic that increases difficulty and rewards by encountering and defeating the Shade of Orobyss. Higher corruption means:
   - Stronger monsters
   - Better loot quality and quantity
   - More experience gain

7. **Season 2 Additions**:
   - Tombs of the Erased: Side areas within Echoes
   - Cemeteries of the Erased: Special Echo types
   - Woven Echoes: Customizable echo zones
   - The Weaver Tree: A passive system for modifying the Monolith experience

#### 2. Dungeons

Dungeons are endgame systems requiring special keys to enter, with each dungeon having its own key type. They follow a similar layout with two maps and a boss arena, and their difficulty scales through tiers.

Last Epoch features three main dungeons:

1. **Temporal Sanctum**:
   - Primary purpose: Legendary crafting facility
   - Allows combining unique and exalted items
   - Higher tiers allow crafting with higher level uniques
   - Contains the most difficult dungeon boss

2. **Soulfire Bastion**:
   - Features enemies dealing fire and necrotic damage
   - Provides special shields for protection
   - Includes gambling mechanics for rare loot
   - Good source for exalted items and uniques with legendary potential

3. **Lightless Arbor**:
   - Challenges players to keep a flame lit
   - Contains unique mechanics and environments
   - Offers special rewards for completion

Dungeon mechanics:

- **Keys**: Required for entry and consumed upon use
- **Tiers**: Increase monster level and reward quality
- **Charms**: Added in Season 2, modify the dungeon experience
- **Layouts**: Semi-randomized with blocked paths changing each run
- **Campaign Skips**: Act as shortcuts between remote zones in the campaign

#### 3. Arena Systems

Last Epoch features two distinct arena systems:

1. **Arena of Champions**:
   - Located in Champions' Gate in the Divine Era
   - Requires an Arena Key to enter
   - Features waves of enemies with increasing difficulty
   - Pauses every 5 waves for loot collection
   - Allows selection of modifiers every 10 waves
   - Changes arena layout every 10 waves

2. **Endless Arena**:
   - Competitive leaderboard system
   - Challenges players to survive as many waves as possible
   - Global ranking based on highest wave reached
   - More focused on competition than efficient gear farming
   - Arena Keys of Memory start at wave 100 or half of your previous record

## Nemesis System Overview

The Nemesis System is a random encounter mechanic added in Last Epoch Patch 1.1 "Harbingers of Ruin" that can be found throughout the Campaign, Monolith of Fate, and Dungeons. When exploring zones, you'll occasionally encounter "the vengeful remains of a Harbinger's victim" appearing as floating armor around a slain warrior, marked by an orange icon on your minimap.

### Nemesis Mechanics

When interacting with a Nemesis, you'll be presented with four potential item rewards and three possible actions:

1. **Banish**: Dismiss the Nemesis and its items, allowing a new selection with the next encounter.

2. **Challenge**: Fight the Nemesis immediately to receive the four offered items if victorious. The Nemesis transforms into a miniboss with various abilities based on the zone type.

3. **Empower**: Fight the Nemesis, which will escape after defeat. The same Nemesis will appear in your next encounter with upgraded items. A Nemesis can be Empowered up to two times before it must be Challenged or Banished.

Each Empowerment improves the offered items by increasing affix tiers, forging potential, or legendary potential, with the possibility of raising affixes to T6 or T7 (the highest tiers). The items retain their initial Empowerment with subsequent Empowerments and are upgraded further.

### Special Rewards

The Nemesis system offers two special item types:

1. **Vengeful Weapons**: Special weapon base types that upgrade when you kill a Harbinger while having the weapon equipped, becoming an "Avenged" version with improved stats. Every weapon and off-hand category has a Vengeful base type.

2. **Egg of the Forgotten**: A special item that appears more frequently at higher character levels (scales from 0% below level 60 to 60% at level 100). When it appears among the four Nemesis reward items, you have three options:
   - Challenge the Nemesis immediately to transform the Egg into a random unique item
   - Replace the Egg with one of your own unique items that lacks Legendary Potential or Weaver's Will, allowing you to empower that item through the Nemesis system
   - Empower the Nemesis with the Egg included, which will cause the Egg to be replaced with a random unique item in the next encounter, potentially with improved stats

   Rank 1 of the Forgotten Knights Faction provides an additional +40% chance for the Egg to spawn.

### Multiplayer Considerations

In multiplayer, the Nemesis system works with some adjustments:
- The Nemesis remains after defeat, allowing each player to interact with it individually
- Each player maintains their own Nemesis Empower progression
- Parties still fight each Nemesis as a group

### Farming Strategy Tips

For efficient Nemesis farming:
- Nemesis type and stats are based on zone level, while loot is based on character level
- The spawn rate increases with Corruption level in Monoliths
- Nemesis encounters have a 15% increased spawn rate in Patch 1.1.2
- The system has spawn protection in campaign to prevent abuse
- Higher area levels can provide better Experimental Affixes

## Exiled Mages

Exiled Mages is a random encounter system that can appear throughout the Campaign and Monolith of Fate, offering exclusive and powerful rewards. According to the lore, these are mages who experimented with forbidden magic and were imprisoned as punishment.

### Encounter Mechanics

Exiled Mages appear as imprisoned figures throughout zones. Here's how they work:

1. **Finding Exiled Mages**: They can spawn on any map except pure boss fights. Look for their distinctive icon on the minimap as you explore. The first few campaign maps don't contain them, but beyond that, they can appear almost anywhere.

2. **Engagement**: When you interact with an imprisoned Exiled Mage, they break free and attack both you and any nearby monsters. These mages are more powerful than regular enemies, using a variety of skills and teleportation abilities.

3. **Combat Challenge**: Exiled Mages are intentionally more challenging than the surrounding enemies, so be prepared for a tougher fight than standard mobs in the area.

### Rewards and Experimental Affixes

The primary draw of hunting Exiled Mages is their unique reward system:

1. **Experimental Affixes**: These are special affixes that can only be obtained from defeating Exiled Mages. They can spawn on any item base type and have various power levels.

2. **Rarity and Power**: Experimental Affixes can be Exalted quality (T6-T7) if the area level is high enough. For the best possible affixes, farm in high-level areas with high Corruption in Empowered Monoliths.

3. **Targeted Farming**: Woven Echoes (from Season 2) are particularly good places to farm Exiled Mages in bulk, as they can contain large numbers of them.

### Crafting with Thaumaturgy Device

Woven Echoes not only provide a great environment for farming Exiled Mages but also offer special crafting options:

1. **Thaumaturgy Device**: After completing a Woven Echo that contains Exiled Mages, you can access the Thaumaturgy Device.

2. **Crafting Process**: Place an item with two prefixes inside the device. You can then select which prefix to replace and what Experimental Affix you want.

3. **Affix Quality**: The prefix tiers of the item you're crafting on determines the likelihood of getting a high-tier Experimental Affix. Higher tier base affixes give better chances at high-tier experimental results.

### Farming Strategy Tips

For optimizing your Exiled Mage hunting:

1. **Focus on Woven Echoes**: These special zones from Season 2 content often contain multiple Exiled Mages.

2. **Area Level Matters**: Higher area levels allow for Exalted-tier Experimental Affixes.

3. **Corruption Scaling**: In Empowered Monoliths, higher Corruption levels improve both spawn rates and potential rewards.

4. **Efficient Pathing**: When specifically farming for Experimental Affixes, focus on full-clearing areas known to have good Exiled Mage spawn rates.

5. **RNG Factor**: Despite all optimization, the specific Experimental Affixes you get are ultimately determined by RNG, so persistence is key.

## UI and Quality of Life Features

Last Epoch includes several interface and convenience features that differ from Path of Exile's approach. These differences may affect your gameplay experience when transitioning between the games.

### User Interface Design

Last Epoch's UI takes a more direct approach to presenting information. Key differences include:

1. **Pre-Identified Items**: All items drop already identified, eliminating the need for identification scrolls
2. **Item Comparison**: Hovering over equipment shows stat differences compared to currently equipped items
3. **HUD Layout**: Core information is grouped to minimize screen clutter
4. **Minimap System**: Adjustable opacity and zoom levels for the overlay map
5. **Menu Organization**: Categorized menus with tabbed navigation for various game functions

### Inventory Management

Several inventory systems differ from PoE's approach:

1. **Crafting Material Storage**: Materials can be automatically sent to crafting storage instead of inventory
2. **Dedicated Idol Grid**: Separate inventory space for character enhancement idols
3. **Shared Storage**: The Eternity Cache allows transferring items between characters
4. **Color-Coded Items**: Default highlighting for different item rarities
5. **No Consumable Portals**: Town portals are free to cast and don't require scrolls

### Game System Conveniences

Last Epoch incorporates several system-level differences:

1. **Gold-Based Respecs**: Characters can respec skill and passive points by paying gold

## Economy and Trading Systems

Last Epoch's economy and trading systems differ significantly from Path of Exile, offering two distinct playstyles to cater to different player preferences.

### Item Factions

Last Epoch's trade system revolves around two competing factions that players must choose between:

1. **Merchant's Guild**:
   - Provides access to the Bazaar where players can gather, socialize, and trade wares
   - Allows buying and selling items with other players
   - Higher faction ranks unlock ability to trade rarer item types
   - Guild reputation grows as you participate in trading

2. **Circle of Fortune**:
   - Provides powerful benefits towards finding more and better items
   - Increases loot drops and drop rarity to help equip your character with Legendary and Unique items
   - Uses a "Prophecy" system for targeted item farming
   - Provides passive bonuses to item acquisition
   - Special "Lens" mechanics to control which prophecies appear

### Trading System: The Bazaar

The Bazaar differs significantly from PoE's trade system:

1. **In-Game Trading Only**: No external websites or APIs required for trade
2. **Asynchronous Trading**: List items for sale at set prices, no need for live player interactions
3. **Favor Currency**: Listing items requires Favor, a currency earned by slaying enemies or completing quests
4. **Reputation Gates**: Higher-value trades require higher Merchant's Guild ranks
5. **Limited Search Options**: Simplified search system compared to PoE trade sites

### Bazaar Listing Process
1. Identify the item you want to sell
2. Access the Bazaar interface at the Merchant's Guild
3. Set a gold price for your item
4. Pay the required Favor cost to list the item
5. Item is removed from your inventory and added to Bazaar listings

### Search and Purchase Process
1. Navigate to the Bazaar search interface
2. Filter by item type, affixes, etc.
3. Browse available listings
4. Purchase desired items, which are delivered to your inventory

### SSF Experience with Circle of Fortune

For those who prefer solo self-found gameplay:

1. **Prophecy System**: Complete objectives to receive targeted item rewards
2. **Drop Rate Bonuses**: Passive increases to drop chances for various item types
3. **Deterministic Farming**: More direct paths to target farming specific items
4. **Lens Mechanic**: Modify which Prophecies appear to focus on desired item types
5. **Solo-Friendly Progression**: All content designed to be completable solo

### Currency Systems

Last Epoch's primary currencies:

1. **Gold**: Universal currency used for vendors, crafting services, and trading
2. **Favor**: Special currency for faction services and trade listings
3. **Crafting Materials**: Type-specific shards, glyphs, and runes used for item crafting
4. **Faction-Specific Currencies**: Special currencies for each faction's services
5. **Memory Amber**: Season 2 currency for the Woven faction

### Trading Community and Culture

The trading community in Last Epoch has developed a distinct culture:

1. **Less Flipping Focus**: The Favor cost of listings discourages mass item flipping
2. **Deterministic Crafting Impact**: Trading less essential due to strong self-crafting options
3. **Balanced Economy**: Less severe RNG means less extreme value disparity in items
4. **Social Integration**: In-game trading encourages more direct community interaction
5. **Seasonal Resets**: Economy refreshes with each new seasonal cycle
